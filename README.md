# C:Y - Week 6 Course Notes

This intro course material covers **web development** and some **python**. 

In past bootcamps I have built web applications and backend services using PHP or JS, but not python until now. To explore the Flask framework I am experimenting with a ***Recipe Vault*** web application that can be found [here](https://github.com/rb-thompson/chefs-advantage).

## Broilerplate Environment Setup

To setup from scratch, [visit the pure broilerplate](https://github.com/rb-thompson/flask-broiler-plate).
